# Webtori!!!
Are you tired of centralized databases? Manually updating links? Linear topological structures? Try Webtori!!

![Webtori banner image. It has a big colored torus and the caption “go beyond webrings”.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/575809098923376650/1005032062111195237/Example_torus.webp)

Webtori is a simple and flexible script to automatically update webring links. It supports up to six directions of page relationships (prev, next, above, below, behind, and in front), allowing for complex topological structures represented by surfaces in up to four dimensions. For example, the humble torus can be accomplished with a collection of left-right webrings and up-down webrings linked together. More complex structures are yet possible:
